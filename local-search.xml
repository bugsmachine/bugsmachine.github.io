We only focus on the basic usage of Django to build api in local environment, so there is no strong requirements for design database or deploy the api. I believe you can make this!!</p><h2 id="Introduction-to-Django"><a href="#Introduction-to-Django" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Django"></a>Introduction to Django</h2><p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a robust set of tools and libraries for building web applications quickly and efficiently. Django follows the principle of “batteries included,” which means it comes with many built-in features and functionalities, allowing developers to focus on writing application code rather than dealing with common web development tasks.<br><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">View Django official webpage</a></p><h2 id="Download-and-config-environment"><a href="#Download-and-config-environment" class="headerlink" title="Download and config environment"></a>Download and config environment</h2><h3 id="Download-Python"><a href="#Download-Python" class="headerlink" title="Download Python"></a>Download Python</h3><p>Django is a Python framework, so you need to have Python environment first. I recommend you to download the latest security version <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python 3.11.5</a>. Follow the installation guidance and run command ‘python’ in terminal. If your terminal shows the same in Figure 1, it means you successfully download Python. Also, you can try some easy additions to double-check.</p><div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="/img/23-09-06-1/2.png" alt="Check python installation" >  <p style="text-align: center;">Figure1: Check python installation</p></div><h3 id="Config-virtual-environment-and-editor"><a href="#Config-virtual-environment-and-editor" class="headerlink" title="Config virtual environment and editor"></a>Config virtual environment and editor</h3><p>Then, we need to create a virtual environment to install our Django project dependencies. You can quickly download by using ‘pip’, enter <code>pip install pipenv</code> in terminal. Please check this blog of my: <a href="https://bugsmachine.github.io/2023/08/26/post1/">How to config PIP if terminal shows “pip” is not a key word</a> if you cannot use pip but you have python environment. </p><p>Now, you need to choose a editor or IDE you like. I am using VS Code but you can also choose other editors like pycharm… You can download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS code</a> here if you donot have it. Once you have it, you need to go to extensions to install Python extension shows in figure 2.</p><div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="/img/23-09-06-1/3.png" alt="Python extension" >  <p style="text-align: center;">Figure2: Python extension</p></div><p>After that, you need to config the vs code’s python interpreter to run the terminal inside vs code. Go to the terminal outside vs code and run command <code>pipenv --venv</code> to check the path and copy it. Go back to vs code, search python interpreter and paste the path with appending ‘&#x2F;bin&#x2F;python’ at the end. </p><p>Now you can open terminal in vs code (under View). If you see your terminal automatically navigate and activate the virtual environment, that means you successfully config the virtual python interpreter.</p><p>Okay, all necessary tools are installed, you can create your first Django project now.</p><h2 id="Create-Django-project"><a href="#Create-Django-project" class="headerlink" title="Create Django project"></a>Create Django project</h2><p>You need to choose a folder for the Django project and install django in the virtual environment. You can create directly or use the terminal. Here is what I do:</p><div><figure><div class="code-wrapper"><pre class="line-numbers language-command" data-language="command"><code class="language-command">cd desktopmkdir storefrontcd storefrontpipenv install djangocode .<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre></div></figure></div><p>Line 1-3 create the folder ‘storefront’ in desktop, line 4 is download django in virtual environment and line 5 is open the folder in vscode. Once you open the project in vs code, you need to active the virtual environment and use python interpreter inside using this command <code>pipenv shell</code>. </p><p>After this, you can open a new Django project via command <code>django-admin startproject xxxxx</code>, here ‘xxxxx’ is the project name. I just name the project storefront the same as the folder name. You will see the the same interface in figure 3 if you successfully create the project. </p><p>Now, you can try command <code>python manage.py runserver</code>, you can ignore the error of unapplied migrations and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:800/">http://127.0.0.1:800/</a> (this is the default url) tp check if the server work well. If you see the webpage like figure 4, congratulation, you successfully run your first Django project. Please pay attention, this webpage will only show up for the first time you run the server.</p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-09-06-1/4.png" alt="Interface after create a project" width="500" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure3: Interface after create a project</p>  </figure>  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-09-06-1/1.png" alt="Successfully run the project" width="500" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure4: Successfully run the project</p>  </figure></div><h2 id="End…"><a href="#End…" class="headerlink" title="End…."></a>End….</h2><p>You must successfully finished everything if you see this section. Next blog we will discuss about settings and urls of your django project.<br>Have a nice day!!!</p>]]></content>

Let’s kick off my Coral World series with this blog post. After a busy summer of SURF work, I finally have some time to focus on my personal projects. Recently, I noticed that my mother-Christmas tree coral has grown significantly since the last time I saw it a month ago. Although I’m not sure of the exact English name for it, let’s simply refer to it as the Christmas tree coral (because it really does resemble one!).</p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/6.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="500" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure1: Mother Christmas Tree Coral</p>  </figure>  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/7.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="500" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure2: My friend'sChristmas Tree Coral</p>  </figure></div><h2 id="Experience-to-raise-a-Christmas-Tree-Coral"><a href="#Experience-to-raise-a-Christmas-Tree-Coral" class="headerlink" title="Experience to raise a Christmas Tree Coral"></a>Experience to raise a Christmas Tree Coral</h2><p>I bought a baby Christmas Tree Coral in December 2022. I don’t know the price in your country but it is really a cheap kind of coral in China, usually only need 20 Chinese yuan (about 2 pounds) for a 3cm juvenile. It’s unnecessary to buy a big one because it can grow at an extraordinary speed beyond your imagination! My tree grew 12cm in 8 months！ Raising this species can bring you a full sense of achievement, you can directly see the growth (see more and more money ~). </p><p>Moreover, this is nearly the most easily raised coral. You don’t need to worry about NO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub>, what you need to do is keep the salinity at 1.020-1.025, and temperature in 25-28 degrees Celsius. I am sure you will get a healthy and thriving Christmas Tree Coral after a few months.</p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/3.png" alt="Image 1" width="300" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure3: Just bought</p>  </figure>  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/5.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="300" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure4: 3 month after</p>  </figure>  <figure>    <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/2.jpg" alt="Image 3" width="300" height="200">    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure5: Now(8 month after)</p>  </figure></div><h2 id="How-a-Christmas-Tree-Coral-reproduct-in-ocean"><a href="#How-a-Christmas-Tree-Coral-reproduct-in-ocean" class="headerlink" title="How a Christmas Tree Coral reproduct in ocean?"></a>How a Christmas Tree Coral reproduct in ocean?</h2><p>From a technical standpoint, the Christmas tree coral has the ability to undergo natural propagation once it reaches a certain size. When the main branch grows to approximately 15cm or larger, it can be considered an ‘adult’ capable of reproduction. An interesting phenomenon occurs where the baby branch fills with an increased amount of water while the other branches experience dehydration. Eventually, the pressure causes the baby branch to separate or be ‘cut off’ from the main branch. This process results in the birth of a baby Christmas tree coral, which is truly a wondrous event. </p><p>If your tank is big enough, you can find 3-5 baby Christmas Tree corals per month in your bottom sand surface (if you have). If you have a big Christmas Tree Coral and never found a baby Christmas Tree Coral, maybe the water flow is too torrential that the baby Christmas Tree Coral cannot stick to something, wash away in to filter bin and killed.</p><h2 id="How-to-manual-breed-a-Christmas-Tree-Coral"><a href="#How-to-manual-breed-a-Christmas-Tree-Coral" class="headerlink" title="How to manual breed a Christmas Tree Coral"></a>How to manual breed a Christmas Tree Coral</h2><p>However, in my case, my tank is not spacious enough to accommodate the coral’s growth to a size suitable for natural ‘propagation’. Therefore, I need to employ some magical techniques (manual intervention) to assist in its parturition. So, how to manually breed a Christmas Tree Coral? In short, just cut! What we need to do is cut a branch off using a scissor instead of water pressure. But keep in mind, you need to confirm your water is clean and pure enough (avoid bacterial infection)!!!!! <em>IMPORTANT!!</em></p><p>Secondly, find an area with flat water and sand which can give the baby tree a place to stick to sand. <em>Attention</em>, you can not stick a baby tree by using coral glue like what you did to an SPS. Christmas Tree corals can generate a kind of mucus to escape from glue, what you need to do is let itself stick to some sand or corallum and you can then stick it (together with sand) to every you want by using coral glue.</p><div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/4.jpg" alt="Mother Christmas Tree Coral" width="300" height="220">  <p style="text-align: center;">Figure6: 2 baby tree</p></div><h2 id="What-if-you-donot-have-an-area-with-flat-water-and-sand"><a href="#What-if-you-donot-have-an-area-with-flat-water-and-sand" class="headerlink" title="What if you donot have an area with flat water and sand?"></a>What if you donot have an area with flat water and sand?</h2><p>My suggestion is by an external isolation box (if you have an adequate budget). However, as a university student(poor~~~), a DIY product may be the first choice. You only need to prepare a plastic box (I used a take-out container), a small water pump, some pipe, a metal screwdriver, and a lighter. Screwdriver and lighter are employed to trepanning on a plastic box, you need to heat the screwdriver which can easily melt plastic. You can use anything else you have to trepan as plastic is not a hard material.</p><p>The principle is to pump water from the main tank and overflow back to the main tank. You can also use some coral glue to leak stoppage and avoid water leakage. Also, you need to pay attention to the size and number of outfalls you make. Water will overflow outside the box if the outfall is too small or not enough in numbers. This is what I made, cost only 2 Chinese yuan (about 0.2 pounds).</p><div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="/img/23-08-26-1/1.jpg" alt="Mother Christmas Tree Coral" width="300" height="220">  <p style="text-align: center;">Figure7: DIY plug-in Box</p></div><h2 id="End…"><a href="#End…" class="headerlink" title="End…."></a>End….</h2><p>Okay, now you already know everything about how to breed Christmas Tree Coral in your tank. You can have a try if you want. Hope you can have a beautiful ocean in your tank!! Hurray!!! See you next time!!!!</p>]]></content>
